# Adaptive Quad Mesh Simplification

This repository contains Python scripts and tools for adaptive quad mesh simplification based on the techniques described in the paper "Adaptive Quad Mesh Simplification" by Bozzi et al. (2010).

## Introduction
Quad meshes are widely used in computer graphics and simulation for representing surfaces. Mesh simplification techniques aim to reduce the complexity of quad meshes while preserving important geometric and topological features. This project implements adaptive quad mesh simplification algorithms to achieve efficient and high-quality mesh reduction.

## Dependencies
Blender Python API (blender-python-api=4.0.0): The project leverages Blender's Python API for mesh operations and visualization.
